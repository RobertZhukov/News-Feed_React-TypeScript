# News-Feed_React-TypeScript


Project view: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/RobertZhukov/News-Feed_React-TypeScript

While developing this learning application(a news feed), I got acquainted with:

- TypeScript
- CSS framework Materialize.

Repeated:
- React Router
- React Hooks
- Localstorage.

The functionality of the application:

1) Creating a news item
2) edit the content of the news by clicking
3) Delete news
4) Implemented a search that allows you to search for news in auto mode while typing, without additional keystrokes or mouse clicks.

The data is saved in localStorage
The app is adaptive for all devices.
